We propose a novel relaxed covariance matrix refularization mechanism. While in GICP, covariance matrix is regularized to plane model. We found that such operation introduces surface modeling errors, which limit the gicp performance. We alleviate this problem by introducing a new mechanism.

See fast_gicp_impl.hpp for details

This is a package for our proposed FD-SLAM. 

The paper "FD-SLAM: Feature&Distribution-based 3D LiDAR SLAM method based on Surface Representation Refinement" is under review.
